 abstract = {A simple formula is developed for the valuation of 
 uncertain income streams consistent with rational risk averse 
 investor behavior and equilibrium in financial markets. Applying 
 this formula to the pricing of an option as a function of its 
 associated stock, the Black-Scholes formula is derived even 
 though investors can only trade at discrete points in time.},

Such a market would also reveal the market assessment of certainty-equivalent growth rates in dividends and thus help to promote rational pricing. Calculations are presented to illustrate the prices at which the index strips might trade, the associated certainty-equivalent growth rates, and the expected returns for given expected dividend growth rates.}

abstract = {It is argued that due to inconsistencies in existing methods to approximate the prices of equity options on assets which pay out fixed cash dividends at future dates, a new approach to this problem may be useful. Logically consistent methods which are guaranteed to exclude arbitrage exist, but they are not very popular in practice due to their computational complexity. An algorithm is defined which is easy to understand, computationally efficient, and which guarantees to generate prices which exclude arbitrage possibilitites. It is shown that for the method to work a mild uniform convergence condition must be satisfied and this condition is indeed satisfied for standard European and American options. Numerical results testify to the accuracy and flexibility of the method.}

	abstract={We study methods to simulate term structures in order to measure interest rate risk more accurately. We use principal component analysis of term structure innovations to identify risk factors and we model their univariate distribution using GARCH-models with Student's t-distributions in order to handle heteroscedasticity and fat tails. We find that the Student's t-copula is most suitable to model co-dependence of these univariate risk factors. We aim to develop a model that provides low ex-ante risk measures, while having accurate representations of the ex-post realized risk. By utilizing a more accurate term structure estimation method, our proposed model is less sensitive to measurement noise compared to traditional models. We perform an out-of-sample test for the U.S. market between 2002 and 2017 by valuing a portfolio consisting of interest rate derivatives. We find that ex-ante Value at Risk measurements can be substantially reduced for all confidence levels above 95{\%}, compared to the traditional models. We find that that the realized portfolio tail losses accurately conform to the ex-ante measurement for daily returns, while traditional methods overestimate, or in some cases even underestimate the risk ex-post. Due to noise inherent in the term structure measurements, we find that all models overestimate the risk for 10-day and quarterly returns, but that our proposed model provides the by far lowest Value at Risk measures.},

	abstract = {We propose a generic framework for performance attribution in monetary terms. Through a second-order Taylor approximation, the changes in portfolio value are attributed to a set of systematic risk factors. By considering two error terms arising from the Taylor approximation, combined with an exact definition of the carry term, we derive a residual-free performance attribution framework, where we exert control over the size of the error terms. The framework incorporates foreign exchange rates and transaction costs, which is illustrated by simulating a European investor acting on the U.S. fixed income market. For the out-of-sample period, we show that we can attribute almost all portfolio value differences and variance using six risk factors obtained from principal component analysis. The results show that our method, in combination with high-quality estimates of risk factors, outperforms other fixed-income attribution models from the literature.}

It is shown that prices for contingent claims to a numeraire commodity have all the formal properties of a probability measure on the states, but still reflect the relative scarcities under alternative states as well as the probabilities of these states. Some implications of the analysis for asset prices, portfolio selection, and investment criteria are mentioned.}
